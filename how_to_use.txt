Script uses ffmpeg-python library you can install with:
    python -m pip install ffmpeg-python

You should put your section folder in files with everything already inside of it.

After putting the folder script will play the sections in alphabetical order.

You can add music and genres into sections but they wont be updated while the current section is still running, it will run when same section plays again.

You will have to copy url and key from your stream to the settings.txt file after the = .

If script stop unexpectedly (as an error) turn ffmpeg_quiet to False(it should be True normally) and send me the entire error message.
